      <p>
        This site highlights parks, buildings, and sites of historical
        significance in Richmond, British Columbia. Located several islands
        including Sea Island, Lulu Island, and Mitchell Island, the City of
        Richmond is located on unceeded territories of the Coast Salish Peoples.
        Namely, the Musquem, Stz'uminus, Stó:lō, Tsawassen, and Tsleil-Waututh
        nations. The goal of this site is to intersect the City of Richmond's
        natural and settler colonial history through the exporation of public
        spaces. As a diverse community of both multi-generational longtime
        residents, and newcomers, it is critical to understand how Richmond came
        to be, and consider the voices of populations that have been oppressed
        over the course of history.
